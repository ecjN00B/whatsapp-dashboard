# WhatsApp Sending Dashboard Project

This is a project for study and improvement purposes that simulates a dashboard of whatsapp sending campaigns in a way similar to what happens with email and SMS in which the scripts were hidden in order not to be commercialized as marketing massive messages.

The first version was developed using HTML + CSS + JavaScript / JQuery for the front-end and will be migrated to Angular 4 soon. (Kudos to [Lucas][lucashenrique] for the good work).
